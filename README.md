# Blue Eye - Real-Time Water Management System

Welcome to the Blue Eye project repository! This project aims to develop a real-time water management system leveraging IoT technology for efficient monitoring and control of water resources. The system integrates sensors, actuators, and data analytics techniques to address challenges associated with water distribution and usage.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring and Control:** Blue Eye enables remote monitoring and control of water resources in real-time, allowing users to efficiently manage water distribution systems.
  
- **IoT Integration:** Leveraging NodeMCU microcontrollers, ultrasonic sensors, and relays, along with Arduino Uno for additional interfacing capabilities, the system provides seamless integration of IoT technology for monitoring and controlling water resources.
  
- **Scalable Backend:** The backend of the system is powered by Firebase, offering scalability and security, ensuring robust performance even with large datasets.
  
- **Cross-Platform UI:** With a Flutter module for the frontend, Blue Eye provides a user-friendly interface across multiple platforms, enabling easy interaction and control.

## Getting Started
